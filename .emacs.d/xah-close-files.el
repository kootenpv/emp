Similar to `kill-buffer', with the following addition:

• Prompt user to save if the buffer has been modified even if the buffer is not associated with a file.
• If the buffer is editing a source file in an org-mode file, prompt the user to save before closing.
• If the buffer is a file, add the path to the list `xah-recently-closed-buffers'.
• If it is the minibuffer, exit the minibuffer
